# Special Topics
## Feelings Algorithms
* understanding feelings as algorithms

This question has two paths
- Logic : What is the logic that creates one fealing or another
- Perception : What is the impact of the feeling on the person, how is it communicated and perceived by others

While perception is easily treatable and rich with examples below, the logic is somehow linked with the complete system and might be hard to dissociate from the brain, conciousness and the self, ego, instincts, goals, and which logics brings a disappointment in which case and satisfaction in which other.
### Feelings percetpion
[Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) touches this topic by trying to infer feelings as way of communication, without necessarily explaining the logic behind feelings. 
### Feelings Perception examples
* Smile recognition (a common feature on cameras is self trigger on smile detection).
* [Video Magnification](http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/) for e.g. heart rate estimation.
* Social impact in a comedy, help for disabled and privacy intrusion as no more able to hide internal thoughts : [Sheldon's emotions detection machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfNnpsYATbQ)

## Artificial Moral agents
* how AI could make better decisions for me than I do for myself ?

Artificial Moral Agents is what targets the question. [AI wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) section : Artificial moral agents and reference (Wendell Wallach (2010). Moral Machines, Oxford University Press.)
